## Airship

Airship has been one of my favorite projects to work on because of the gargantuan scope and scale of the ask. Coupled with a rebrand and renaming, we were also redesigning their site and migrating 1400 pages of content from an older unsupported CMS to a modern Wordpress editing experience.

I led a team in engineering a customized user experience based on the WordPress Gutenberg platform. Building upon that core framework, we developed a flexible and powerful editing experience for the Airship marketing team to maintain and generate new content that conforms to their new brand guide.

## Okta

I've helped Okta maintain and grow their site over the past five years. That's included new microsites each year such as their [Businesses @ Work](https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2020/) reports, Oktane event sites, and maintaining their lead flow which generates thousands of contacts on a daily basis.

Most recently, as part of a larger development team, we migrated their corporate site from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. This was an enormous undertaking constituting hundreds of hours of work over the course of only two months.
